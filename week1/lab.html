<div class="slide">
	<p>We covered a lot this week in the lab so I want to review what we talked about here for future references and review.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We started with the two main functions in any p5 based JavaScript program: <code>setup</code> & <code>draw</code></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<pre><code>function setup() {

}</code></pre>
	<p>Let's look at this line by line, because there's a lot happening.</p>
	<pre><code>function setup() {</code></pre>
	<p>This is a typical function <em><i>declaration</i></em> starting with the keyword <code>function</code>.</p>
